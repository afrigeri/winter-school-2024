VRGS can be downloaded from

https://apps.vrgeoscience.com/index.html

You will most likely need to use the MSIX installer. This approach allows VRGS to update automatically when a new release is available, like a Windows store application. If your administrators don't allow this approach (side-loading) then use the MSI installer instead. In this case, you will need to update manually.

VRGS needs a license key to run, if you check your emails about the winter school the key should be in there. You can always request a trial license key from:
